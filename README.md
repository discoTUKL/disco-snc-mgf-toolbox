# Stochastic Network Calculus with Moment Generating Function (Python)

The (sigma, rho)-calculus is implemented in this tool. It is supposed to provide solutions quickly for small networks. Yet, it must not show weak points when it comes to parameter optimization. It also includes a new approach using Jensen inequality to improve the output bound.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Python packages in `requiremets.txt`

## Introduction

#### Compute Bound Directly

The easiest start is to use `Calculate_Examples.py`. Set a performance parameter, e.g., by

```python
OUTPUT_TIME6 = PerformParameter(perform_metric=PerformMetric.OUTPUT, value=6)
```

we compute the output bound for time delta = 6.

```python
SINGLE_SERVER = SingleServerPerform(arr=DM1(lamb=1.0),
                                    ser=ConstantRate(rate=10.0),
                                    perform_param=OUTPUT_TIME6)
```

means that we consider the single hop topology with exponentially distributed arrival increments (DM1 with parameter lambda equal to 1) and a constant rate server (with rate 10).

```python
print(SINGLE_SERVER.get_bound(0.1))
```

for theta = 0.1.

For the new output bound computation, we insert a list of parameters (first element is theta, the rest are for the new output bound computation):

```python
[0.1, 2.7]
```

and compute

```python
print(SINGLE_SERVER.get_new_bound([0.1, 2.7]))
```

#### Compute Optimized Bound

Assume we want to optimize the parameter for the above setting. Therefore, we choose to optimize, e.g., via grid search.
We optimize the bound in the SINGLE_SERVER setting with the old approach "Optimize" and the new approach OptimizeNew and want to print the optimal parameter set ("print_x=true"). The last step is to choose the method "grid_search()" and to set the search's granularity (in this case = 0.1):

```python
print(Optimize(SINGLE_SERVER, print_x=True).grid_search(
        bound_list=[(0.1, 5.0)], delta=0.1))
```

and for the new version:

```python
print(OptimizeNew(SINGLE_SERVER, new=True, print_x=True).grid_search(
        bound_list=[(0.1, 5.0), (0.9, 8.0)], delta=0.1))
```

## Status of Implementation

Network Calculus operations:

- Convolution
- Deconvolution
- Aggregation
- Leftover service

Performance Metrics:

- Backlog bound for a given probability and vice versa
- Delay bound for a given probability and vice versa
- MGF-output bound

Arrival processes:

- DM1
- MD1
- Markov modulated on-off traffic (MMOO)
- Exponentially bounded burstiness (EBB)
- Token Bucket

For the service, only a constant rate server is available.

Topologies / settings:

- Single server
- Fat tree

- OTCS2018/ submission at Open Transactions on Communication Systems (OTCS) 2018

## Folder Structure

- dnc
  Only contains the delay bound for deterministic token bucket arrivals
- library
  Contains all helper classes, for example:
  - `array_to_results.py` takes an input Numpy-array, performs an analysis and write the results in a dictionary
  - `compare_old_new.py` compares the standard approach with the new bound
  - `perform_parameter.py` stores emum PerformMetric (delay, output,...) and its value
- nc_operations
  Network Calculus Operations, (De-)Convolution and computation of performance metrics (delay, backlog, delay probability)
- nc_processes
  All arrival and service processes, such as MMOO and constant rate server
- optimization
  All classes that are necessary for the parameter optimization, as this is an important aspect of MGF-calculus.
- simulation and simulation fluid
  Simulation, i.e., no bound computation, with packets or in a fluid model. Only very basic.

The topologies have their own dedicated folders as they also include all classes needed for a performance evaluation (random input parameters, save results in csv-files)
